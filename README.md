# food-order-application



• This is a demo food order app through this project I managed to create a great opportunity to sharpen my skills in React context API, handling HTTP requests, and user
input handling (forms) as I integrated Firebase services as a demo back end.

• It gave me an opportunity to challenge myself and expand my capabilities in React JS.
